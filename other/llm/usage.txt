please write me 3 tests skeletons to test this dataset in r code.

ChatGPT
To create test skeletons in R, we first need to consider what aspects of the dataset "analysis_data.csv" we might want to test. Common tests might include checking for missing values, validating data types, and ensuring the data conforms to expected ranges or distributions.

I'll outline three test skeletons using the testthat package in R. You can expand upon these tests based on your specific requirements for the dataset.

1. Test for No Missing Values
This test will check if there are any missing (NA) values in the dataset.

r
Copy code
library(testthat)
library(readr)

# Load the data
data <- read_csv("path_to_your_data/analysis_data.csv")

# Test to ensure there are no missing values in the dataset
test_that("No missing values in dataset", {
  expect_true(all(complete.cases(data)))
})
2. Test for Correct Data Types
This test ensures that each column in your dataset has the correct data type. You need to replace the expected_types list with the expected types of your columns.

r
Copy code
# Test to ensure data types are as expected
test_that("Data types are correct", {
  expected_types <- list(
    "Column1" = "character",
    "Column2" = "numeric",
    "Column3" = "factor"
    # Add other columns as needed
  )
  
  for (col in names(expected_types)) {
    expect_true(is(data[[col]], expected_types[[col]]),
                info = paste("Column", col, "should be of type", expected_types[[col]]))
  }
})
3. Test for Range of Values in a Numeric Column
This test checks if numeric values fall within an expected range. You need to specify the column and its expected range.

r
Copy code
# Test that numeric values are within an expected range
test_that("Values are within expected range", {
  column_name <- "NumericColumn" # replace with your actual column name
  expected_min <- 0  # replace with the minimum expected value
  expected_max <- 100  # replace with the maximum expected value

  expect_true(all(data[[column_name]] >= expected_min & data[[column_name]] <= expected_max),
              info = paste("Values in", column_name, "should be between", expected_min, "and", expected_max))
})
To run these tests, make sure the testthat package is installed and that you have correctly set the path to your dataset. Modify each skeleton to fit the specific characteristics and requirements of your data.

abstract: "In this paper, we explore the connection between education and hourly wages in Canada, focusing on data from the year 2000. Our findings indicate a clear trend: higher educational levels correlate with increased average hourly wages for individuals aged 25 to 54. This research highlights the importance of education in determining earning potential and suggests that investment in education could have long-term economic benefits. The study provides evidence for policy implications regarding educational incentives and workforce development strategies in Canada."

Abstract: "This paper examines the relationship between education and hourly wages in Canada, using data from the year 2000. We find a significant trend: higher educational attainment is associated with increased average hourly wages among individuals aged 25 to 54. This research underscores the role of education in shaping earning potential and advocates for educational investments as a strategy for long-term economic growth. Our findings support policy initiatives aimed at enhancing educational incentives and developing the workforce in Canada."

# Introduction {#sec-intro}

The relationship between education and earnings is a well-established topic of interest within the field of labor economics, providing insights into the broader socio-economic fabric of a country. As Canada's economy continues to diversify and specialize in various sectors, the value of education in this landscape remains a critical question for policymakers and the public. While previous studies have explored this link, there is an ongoing need to update and deepen our understanding of how this dynamic plays out in the modern economy.

This paper narrows the focus to the Canadian labor market, where the interplay between educational achievement and wages within the core working age group, those aged 25-54, offers a mirror to the efficacy and value of educational advancements in the workplace. This demographic is selected for its relevance to the labor force and policy implications, excluding younger individuals still likely in the education system and older individuals, who may present outlier educational experiences that do not align with the central workforce.

This investigation seeks to address a gap in the current literature by providing a targeted analysis of the 25-54 age group in Canada since the year 2000, a period marked by rapid technological change and economic evolution. By applying a linear model to wage data categorized by education level, this study uncovers a positive correlation between educational attainment and hourly wages, suggesting that higher education can be linked to improved wage outcomes in this key demographic.

The structure of the paper is organized as follows: Following @sec-intro, @sec-data presents the data, detailing the data sources, analytical techniques, and the rationale behind the chosen methods. @sec-model then covers the specifics of the linear model analysis, laying out the statistical underpinnings that support our investigation. After that, @sec-result discusses the results, elaborating on the observed trends and patterns in wage rate data. @sec-discussion interprets these findings in light of the current economic and educational context in Canada, exploring potential factors influencing these trends, drawing connections to broader socio-economic issues, and providing suggestions for future research in this area.

Introduction {#sec-intro}
The link between education and earnings is a well-explored area within labor economics, offering insights into the broader socio-economic landscape of a country. As Canada's economy evolves, becoming increasingly diverse and specialized, understanding the value of education remains crucial for policymakers and the public alike. Although prior studies have examined this relationship, there remains a need to refresh and enhance our understanding as the economy changes.

This paper focuses specifically on the Canadian labor market, examining how educational achievement correlates with wages among the core working age group of 25 to 54 years. This demographic is chosen for its direct relevance to the labor force and its significant implications for policy, deliberately excluding younger individuals likely still in education and older individuals whose experiences might not reflect current workforce trends.

Our study addresses a gap in existing literature by providing a detailed analysis of this age group since the year 2000â€”a period characterized by significant technological and economic shifts. We employ a linear model to analyze wage data categorized by education level, revealing a positive correlation between educational attainment and hourly wages, which indicates that higher education may lead to better wage outcomes for this crucial demographic.

The paper is structured as follows: After this introduction (@sec-intro), @sec-data describes the data sources, analysis techniques, and the rationale for the chosen methods. @sec-model details the linear model analysis and its statistical foundations. @sec-result presents the results, discussing the trends and patterns observed in the wage data. Finally, @sec-discussion interprets these findings within the context of Canada's current economic and educational climate, explores factors influencing these trends, connects them to broader socio-economic issues, and suggests avenues for further research.
